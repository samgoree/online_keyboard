# Online Keyboard

A pet project I'm doing while learning React.js -- An in-browser keyboard app that uses the web midi API for I/O.

Future plans:

 - Add I/O menus so that other people can use it.
 - Add custom effects for keys that don't correspond to normal piano keyboards
 - Better UI, potentially with a graphics library (if I get that far)
 - custom JS for the effects on the texture that a key press will have
